## AOD 4184 in bulk

I wrote about cheap 4184 based switches that are readily available on Amazon and I use a lot. 

They are around 2-2.50$$. However, you can order them in bulk, here is a roll of a 1000 (thousand) at 11 cents each.

The Amazon switches are fairly simple:

add a couple of resistors and you don't have to wait for shipping or stock them. LED is optional. 

These can be used in parallel, as in this package, there is a pair of them. Two is not a limit, but driving more than two will add additional complexity and challenges, probably at least a MOSFET driver.

This is something that I'll look into. At 25W each, there is a posssibility to stack them into some special form factor (cooling wise) and still be far cheaper at what a lot of power MOSFETS are sold retail in US.
