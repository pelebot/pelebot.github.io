## 400W MOSFETs for laughs

if you can't find a decent comedy on Amazon, head out to electronics sales. This is my go to MOSFET module that use a lot. It's cheap, decent frequency PWM and I never had issues driving it from 3v bare pins, no MOSFET drivers needed.

... except that these are not "400" ... not even 40W modules.

If you look on the chip, it's an AOD 4184. Spec Pdsm is 2.3W each, but you can do some reality check here, your soldering iron is probably 15-30WW and I have soldered these on.
