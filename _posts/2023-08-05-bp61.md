## 400W MOSFETs for laughs

if you can't find a decent comedy on Amazon, head out to electronics sales. This is my go to MOSFET module that I use a lot. It's cheap, decent frequency PWM and I never had issues driving it from 3v bare pins, no MOSFET drivers needed.

... except that these are not "400" ... not even 40W modules.

If you look on the chip, it's an AOD 4184. Spec Pdsm is 2.3W each, but you can do some reality check here, your soldering iron is probably 15-30WW and I have soldered these on ... back on

Here is a photo from one of our minibots we ran in 2022. It uses two of these modules for each wheel, juiced up to 6S and drawing may be 1.5A at stall, intermittenly. A few seconds of stalling these is all it takes for them to simply fall off the board.

... but that's not all. YouTube has vids on 4184 modules with narrator claiming a 600W rating!!!

The sad part is that this channel in particular is 150k subscribers and not a single comment about the insanity of these claims. Frankly, I am not sure how much of this video is simply regurgitation to beef up weekly content.
