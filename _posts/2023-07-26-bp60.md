## Current combat robot list at NHRL

This is our third season at NHRL. Here is a complete list of bots fielded so far. That's quiet a few bots, I even forgot some. Some pages need to be updated and given pics that I have floating somewhere.

For the record, it's not a simple field. There are close to 200 bots competing each event, with some of the most talented and well known (in other competitions) builders, engineers and drivers. 
We have been able to qualify two previous seasons for the finals. This means a whole lot to make it.

In addition, last year NHRL offered 5'000$ to each qualifier to donate to the charity of their choice. We have chosen Alex' middle school First team and are very proud to be able to help out.
